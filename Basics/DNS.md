# DNS - Domain Name System

- As Humans identify with names, Computers identify as numbers. In order to bridge the communication gap between Humans and Computers, Networking Engineers developed DNS
- Basically DNS works like Contacts Application - whenever you want to find your girlfriends number you dont lookup the number, you lookup her name and then it will give her number.
- DNS resolves Name to Numbers
- Resolves Domain Names to IP Addresses
