### SSL TLS HTTPS ü§ù


SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are technologies that help to keep information that you send over the internet safe and secure. They do this by encrypting the data, which means that it is converted into a secret code that can only be read by the intended recipient.

When you use HTTPS to visit a website, your computer establishes a secure connection with the website's server using SSL/TLS. This helps to protect your information, such as your login credentials and any other personal information that you might enter on the site, from being intercepted by anyone else.

So, to summarize, SSL/TLS helps to keep your information safe and secure when you're using the internet by encrypting it so that only the intended recipient can read it.

Steps involved in setting up a secure HTTPS connection using TLS

- The client sends a request to the server to initiate the TLS handshake process.

- The server sends its TLS certificate to the client. The certificate includes the server's public key and other information that the client needs to verify the identity of the server.

- The client verifies the certificate, and if it is trusted, it generates a random symmetric key and sends it to the server encrypted with the server's public key.

- The server decrypts the key using its private key and sends a message back to the client to acknowledge receipt of the key.

- Both the client and server can now use the shared key to encrypt and decrypt data transmitted between them.

- The client and server exchange data using the secure TLS connection.


In TLS (Transport Layer Security), the public key, private key, and session key are used to establish a secure connection between two parties.

The public key and private key are part of a public key infrastructure (PKI) system, in which the public key is used to encrypt messages and the private key is used to decrypt them. The public key is shared with others, while the private key is kept secret.

During the TLS handshake, the client and server exchange their public keys to establish a secure connection. They then use these keys to establish a session key, which is a symmetric key that is used to encrypt and decrypt the data transmitted during the session. The session key is generated by the client and encrypted with the server's public key, so that only the server can decrypt it.

Once the session key has been established, the client and server can use it to encrypt and decrypt data transmitted during the session, ensuring that it is secure and private.
