## #️⃣ Consistent Hashing :


Consistent Hashing is a distributed hashing scheme that operates independently of the number of servers or objects in a distributed hash table by assigning them a position on an abstract circle, or hash ring. This allows servers and objects to scale without affecting the overall system.

### Problem with Consistent Hashing -

Frequent Additions and Removals of Servers
Skwed Load on Server

### Remedy -
Virtual Server Nodes

### Advantages - 
Because of Consistant Hashing there is load balancing and no duplication (watch guarav sen message queue video for more explanation)
