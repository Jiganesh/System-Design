A Representational State Transfer (REST) API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning resources. REST was initially created as a guideline to manage communication on a complex network like the internet.
