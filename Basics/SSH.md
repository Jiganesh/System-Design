Imagine you have a girlfriend (you need to imagine that surely you dont have one ðŸ˜‚) and you want to send her a love letter and probably you want no one to read it. What you do is take a box put that love letter inside that box and lock it. The key is only available to you for the lock lets call it key1. Now you send the box to your girlfriend. She cannot open the box yet as she doesn't have a key (key1) to open it. She puts another lock on the same box with another key which is key2.

She sends the box back to you, and you open the box with key1. Sending box back to her with no need of key1 anymore. After your girlfriend receives the box she can open it with key2 she has and read your love letter. With this she accessed your love letter without any data breach in secured way.

SSH  (Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell) communication happens the same way between your local machine and remote host.

Functions that SSH enables include the following:

- secure remote access to SSH-enabled network systems or devices for users, as well as automated processes;
- secure and interactive file transfer sessions;
- automated and secured file transfers;
- secure issuance of commands on remote devices or systems; and
- secure management of network infrastructure components.

What are the Issues with SSH ?

The biggest threat to SSH is poor key management. Without the proper centralized creation, rotation and removal of SSH keys, organizations can lose control over who has access to which resources and when, particularly when SSH is used in automated application-to-application processes.
